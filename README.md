# Progressive/responsive image component

`<Image />` is a Svelte component specially designed to work seamlessly with DatoCMSâ€™s [`responsiveImage` GraphQL query](https://www.datocms.com/docs/content-delivery-api/uploads#responsive-images) that optimizes image loading for your sites.

This is a port to Svelte from react version.

### The `ResponsiveImage` object

The `data` prop expects an object with the same shape as the one returned by `responsiveImage` GraphQL call. It's up to you to make a GraphQL query that will return the properties you need for a specific use of the `<Image>` component.

- The minimum required properties for `data` are: `aspectRatio`, `width`, `sizes`, `srcSet` and `src`;
- `alt` and `title`, while not mandatory, are all highly suggested, so remember to use them!
- You either want to add the `webpSrcSet` field or specify `{ auto: format }` in your `imgixParams`, to automatically use WebP images in browsers that support the format;
- If you provide both the `bgColor` and `base64` property, the latter will take precedence, so just avoiding querying both fields at the same time, it will only make the response bigger :wink:

Here's a complete recap of what `responsiveImage` offers:
